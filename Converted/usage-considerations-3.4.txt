Alberta Community and Social Services Open Data
Emergency Shelters Daily Occupancy Data

Usage Considerations
Definitions
Capacity: The maximum amount of occupants that each shelter is licensed to have residing in the shelter at any given time according to fire code regulations.

Total Overnight: The total number of individuals that were admitted to the shelter for an overnight stay at any point in the night.  

Daytime Clients: The total number of individuals who were served within warming centres or 24/7 shelters in a 24 hour period (12:00am - 12:00am).

Utilization Rates: A measure of how much shelter space is being utilized on average in a given month. Represented as a percentage of either the shelter's capacity, the number of funded spaces, or the number of rooms (i.e., within family emergency shelters). Calculated by dividing the average overnight occupancy by the average capacity/funded spaces.

Notes for 2020 Data
In 2020, occupancy is tallied somewhat differently from shelter to shelter. Some shelters conduct a one-time count at a given point in the night (e.g., 10:00pm; 5:00am). Others track the total number of individuals that have been admitted to the shelter for an overnight stay at any point in the night. These count methodologies provide somewhat different results as individuals will come and go through the night and may not be present for specific one-time counts.

For Family Emergency Shelters (Inn from the Cold & Brenda's House), utilization rates are also reported based on the number of bedrooms, which is a more accurate representation of how full the shelter is (as often the families staying in rooms will be less than the capacity of the room).
